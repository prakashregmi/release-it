## üíæ Installation

### Global

As a globally available CLI tool:

```bash
npm install --global release-it
```

### Local

As a `devDependency` in your project:

```
npm install --save-dev release-it
```

Add this as a `script` to `package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "release": "release-it"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "release-it": "^4.2.0"
  }
}
```

Now you can run `npm run release` from the command line.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Release a new patch (increments from e.g. `1.0.4` to `1.0.5`):

```bash
release-it
```

Release a patch, minor, major, or specific version:

```bash
release-it minor
release-it 0.8.3
```

See [manage pre-releases](#-manage-pre-releases) for versions like `1.0.0-beta.2` and `npm install my-package@next`.

You can also do a "dry run", which won't write/touch anything, but does output the commands it would execute, and show the interactivity:

```bash
release-it --dry-run
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Out of the box, release-it has sane defaults, and plenty of options to configure it. Put the options to override in `.release-it.json` in the project root. Example:

```
{
  "src": {
    "tagName": "v%s"
  },
  "github": {
    "release": true
  }
}
```

* Only the settings to override need to be in `.release-it.json`. Everything else will fall back to the [default configuration](conf/release-it.json).
* You can use `--config` if you want to use another path for the local `.release-it.json`. 

Any option can also be set on the command-line, and will have highest priority. Example:

```bash
release-it minor --src.tagName='v%s' --github.release
```

Boolean arguments can be negated by using the `no-` prefix:

```bash
release-it --no-npm.publish
```

## ü§ñ Interactive vs. non-interactive mode

By default, release-it is interactive and allows you to confirm each task before execution:

<img src="./assets/release-it.png?raw=true" height="148">

On a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, or by using the `-n` option, this is fully automated. No prompts are shown and the configured tasks will be executed. This is demonstrated in the first animation above. An overview of the default tasks:

Task | Option | Default | Prompt | Default
:--|:--|:-:|:--|:-:
Ready (confirm version) | N/A | N/A | - | `Y`
Show staged files | N/A | N/A | `prompt.src.status` | `N`
Git commit | `src.commit` | `true` | `prompt.src.commit` | `Y`
Git push | `src.push` | `true` | `prompt.src.push` | `Y`
Git tag | `src.tag` | `true` | `prompt.src.tag` | `Y`
GitHub release | `github.release` | `false` | `prompt.src.release` | `Y`
npm publish | `npm.publish` | `true` | `prompt.src.publish` | `Y`

The left columns are default options in non-interactive (or CI) mode.

The `prompt.*` options on the right in the table are used for the default answers in interactive mode. You can still change the answer to either `Y` or `N` as the questions show up (or cancel the process with `Ctrl-c`).

Also, if e.g. `npm.publish` is `false`, the related prompt (`prompt.src.publish`) will not be shown (regardless of its default answer).

## üîó Command Hooks

The command hooks are executed from the root directory of the `src` or `dist` repository, respectively:

* `src.beforeStartCommand`
* `beforeChangelogCommand`
* `buildCommand` - before files are staged for commit
* `src.afterReleaseCommand`
* `dist.beforeStageCommand` - before files are staged in dist repo
* `dist.afterReleaseCommand`

All commands can use configuration variables (like template strings):

```bash
"buildCommand": "tar -czvf foo-${src.tagName}.tar.gz ",
"afterReleaseCommand": "echo Successfully released ${version} to ${dist.repo}."
```

## üì° SSH keys & git remotes

The tool assumes you've configured your SSH key and Git remotes correctly. In short: you're fine if you can `git push`. Otherwise, the following GitHub help pages might be useful: [SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and [Managing Remotes](https://help.github.com/categories/managing-remotes/).

## ‚úèÔ∏è GitHub Release

See this project's [releases page](https://github.com/webpro/release-it/releases) for an example.

To create [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/):

* The `github.release` option must be `true`.
* Obtain a [GitHub access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
* Make this available as the environment variable defined with `github.tokenRef`. Example:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="f941e0..."
```

### üì¶ Release Assets

To upload binary release assets with a GitHub release (such as compiled executables,
minified scripts, documentation), provide one or more glob patterns for the `github.assets` option. After the release, the assets are available to download from the GitHub release page. Example:

```json
"github": {
  "release": true,
  "assets": "dist/*.zip"
}
```

## üê£ Manage Pre-releases

With release-it, it's easy to create pre-releases: a version of your software that you want to make available, while it's not in the stable semver range yet. Often "alpha", "beta", and "rc" (release candidate) are used as identifier for pre-releases.

For example, if you're working on a new major update for `awesome-pkg` (while the latest release was v1.4.1), and you want others to try a beta version of it:

```
release-it major --preRelease=beta
```

This will tag and release version `2.0.0-beta.0`. This is actually a shortcut for:

```
release-it premajor --preReleaseId=beta --npm.tag=beta --github.preRelease
```

Consecutive beta releases (`v2.0.0-beta.1` and so on) are now easy:

```
release-it --preRelease=beta
```

Installing the package with npm:

```
npm install awesome-pkg         # Installs v1.4.1
npm install awesome-pkg@beta    # Installs v2.0.0-beta.1
```

You can still override e.g. the npm tag being used:

```
release-it --preRelease=rc --npm.tag=next
```

See [semver.org](http://semver.org) for more details.

## Custom or Conventional Changelog

### Recommended Bump

If your project follows the [Angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits), the special `conventional:angular` increment shorthand can be used to get the recommended bump based on the commit messages:

```
{
  "increment": "conventional:angular"
}
```

### Generate Custom Changelog

You can use tools like [conventional-changelog-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli) to generate the changelog for the GitHub release. Make sure that the `changelogCommand` outputs the changelog to `stdout`. In the next example, `beforeChangelogCommand` is also used, to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file (and part of the release commit).

```
{
  "increment": "conventional:angular",
  "beforeChangelogCommand": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s",
  "changelogCommand": "conventional-changelog -p angular | tail -n +3",
  "safeBump": false
}
```

The `safeBump` option was introduced for this use case, to make sure the bump is done as late as possible (after the `changelogCommand` is executed).

## üöö Distribution Repository

Some projects use a distribution repository. Reasons to do this include:

* Distribute to target specific package managers.
* Distribute to a Github Pages branch (also see [Using GitHub Pages, the easy way](https://medium.com/@webprolific/using-github-pages-the-easy-way-bb7acc46f45b)).

Overall, it comes down to a need to release generated files (such as compiled bundles, documentation) into a separate repository. Some examples include:

* Projects like Ember, Modernizr and Bootstrap are in separate [shim repositories](https://github.com/components).
* AngularJS maintains a separate [packaged angular repository](https://github.com/angular/bower-angular) for distribution on npm and Bower.

To use this feature, set the `dist.repo` option to a git endpoint. This can be a branch (also of the same source repository), like `"git@github.com:webpro/release-it.git#gh-pages"`. Example:

```json
"dist": {
  "repo": "git@github.com:components/ember.git"
}
```

The repository will be cloned to `dist.stageDir`, and the `dist.files` (relative to `dist.baseDir`) will be copied from the source repository. The files will then be staged, commited and pushed back to the remote distribution repository.

Make sure to set `dist.github.release` and `dist.npm.publish` to `true` as needed. The `dist.github.*` options will use the `github.*` values as defaults. Idem dito for `dist.npm.*` options, using `npm.*` for default values.

During the release of a source and distribution repository, some "dist" tasks are executed before something is committed to the source repo. This is to make sure you find out about errors (e.g. while cloning or copying files) as soon as possible, and not after a release for the source repository first.

## üìù Notes

* The `"private": true` setting in package.json will be respected and the package won't be published to npm.
* You can use `src.pushRepo` option to set an alternative url or name of a remote as in `git push <src.pushRepo>`. By default this is `null` and  `git push` is used when pushing to the remote.
